Sudokish: A Sudoku Puzzle in HMMM Assembly

Sudokish.hmm and Sudokish.lbl are components of a Sudoku puzzle solver developed in HMMM (Harvard Miniature Machine) assembly language as part of a Computer Organization project. This project showcases fundamental concepts of low-level programming, including memory management, control flow, and logical operations.
